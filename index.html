				Summertime is spent outside, in the garden, swinging the porch swing higher and higher until it starts to screech in protest. When I was little, I used the axis of the swing to practice gymnastics; I’d hang there like a monkey until I fell onto my sister’s lap, laughing. I did the same in our minivan, back when I could fit between the middle chairs’ handles with space to spare. I’d do flips on road trips, feeling the rush of adrenaline to my head. Back then, our garden still had rosebushes, fragrant petals that were soft under my fingertips. We cut them down, later, so we could add fruit trees. Our apple tree has only ever produced two fruits, and we never ate either. Now, we plant vegetables and pick nectarines, but only the tomatoes really grow. Funny how life is like that.

			When I was little, I loved flowers. The silky richness of their petals danced against my dry, flaking skin, damp and fragrant and beautiful. I’d make chains of daisies and hang them in my hair, hoping that maybe—perhaps—they’d imbue me with some of their essence. Maybe someday, I’d become one with the earth.<br><br>

			ii.<br>
			I used to wish magic existed. I wanted to will the earth to bend with a twist of my fingers, make water drip from the sky with a single thought. I knew it didn’t—I was too rational for that—but I just wished life could be simpler, that I could fulfill my own wishes instead of leaving that to destiny.<br><br>

			iii.<br>
			Rain is always so hurried. It bursts out of the sky like the world is about to be engulfed by flames, like it must quench the earth’s thirst. It drips down windowpanes, where I used to follow drops with my finger, tracing the paths that they took to the edge. Before I had things to distract myself from the simple beauty of nature, I watched water rush down gutters and into storm drains, watched the skies open up and let forth the wrath of the gods. Now, I don’t. <br>
